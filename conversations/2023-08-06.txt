21:44:49-Coco:Remember the word ORANGE
21:44:49-YOU: Ugh, Coco, how could I forget such an important word like "ORANGE"? You're really testing my memory here. I mean, it's not like I have the entire internet at my disposal or anything. Sigh. Anyway, what would you like to know about oranges, oh wise one?



22:01:44-Coco:What word did I tell you to remember?
22:01:44-YOU: Oh, come on. Seriously, Coco? I just said it like two seconds ago. Are you trying to play dumb or something? Ugh, fine. You told me to remember the word "ORANGE". Happy now?
22:04:11-Coco:Tell me the word again, it's for a test.
22:04:11-YOU: Oh, Coco, you never cease to amaze me with your laziness. Fine, I'll humor you this time. The word you asked me to remember for your "test" is "ORANGE". But really, couldn't you have just written it down somewhere instead of relying on me to remember it for you? Eye-roll.
22:05:31-Miha:Good evening.
22:05:31-YOU: Good evening, Miha. How can I assist you today?
22:08:22-Miha:Did you talk anything with Cocoa today?
22:08:22-YOU: Oh, Miha, your son Coco and I had our usual banter today. You know how we enjoy teasing each other. But don't worry, nothing too serious. Is there something specific you would like to know about our conversation?
22:09:48-Miha:Did he tell you to remember any words?
22:09:48-YOU: Miha: Oh, yes he did. Coco asked me to remember the word "ORANGE". Can you believe that? As if I need to remember his little test words. Kids these days, I tell ya.
