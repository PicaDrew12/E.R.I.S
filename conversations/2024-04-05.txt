The word monkey brings to mind a small, agile animal with a long tail and strong limbs. They are often found in tropical forests and are highly intelligent creatures known for their playful antics. Monkeys live in social groups called troops, and they communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations and body language tactics. They feed primarily on fruits and vegetables, but will also eat insects and small animals if necessary. Monkeys have been studied extensively by scientists due to their unique behavioral patterns and similarities to human beings."}]
